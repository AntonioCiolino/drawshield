#summary Divisions - Partitions of two or more tinctures

=Introduction=

When a division is applied to a shape it is partitioned into two or more sections and can have
either two or three tinctures. They can be applied to anything, but most commonly are applied to 
the field.

==Large Divisions of Two Tinctures==

These divisions split the shield into two large areas.

The basic syntax is:
{{{
[Division] [DivisionModifier] [Tincture] and [Tincture]
}}}

The available divisions are:

*chape*, *chausse*, *per-bend*, *per-bend sinister*, 
*per-chevron*, *per-fess*,
*per-pale*, *per-pile*, *per-saltire*, *pily*, *pily-bendy*, *pily-bendy-sinister*,
*quarterly*, *quarterly-per-fess*, *quarterly-per-pale*

Instead of *per bend* you can use *party per bend* or *parted bendwise*, and similarly for the other divisions.

==Large Divisions of Three Tinctures==

{{{
[Division] [DivisionModifier] [Tincture] and [Tincture] and [Tincture] 
}}}

The available divisions are:

*per-pall*, *per-pall-reversed*, *tierced-in-pale*, *tierced-in-fess*
      
==Bar Type Divisions (Two Tinctures)==

These divisions are made out of a variable number of bars, with the syntax

{{{
[Division] {of [Number]} [DivisionModifier] [Tincture] and [Tincture]
}}}

The available divisions are:

*barry*, *barry-pily*, *bendy*, *bendy sinister*, *paly* 

It is an error if the given number is odd, less than 4 or greater than 20.

In addition, the following bar type divisions are available but it is not (yet) possible
to specify the number of bars:

*barry-bendy*, *barry-bendy-sinister*, *barry-indented the one in the other*, *paly-bendy*

==Patterned Divisions (Two Tinctures)==

These divisions are a bit like [Treatment treatments] but are of a fixed size. They are:

*chevronny* {*of* 4,5,6,7 or 8}, *fusily*, *lozengy*, *gyronny* {*of* 6,8,10 or 12}
