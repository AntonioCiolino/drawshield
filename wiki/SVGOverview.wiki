#summary Overview of how SVG code is generated
=Important Note=

This is copied from old document and needs to be reviewed for the PHP5 version

  <h1>SVG Content</h1>
  <p>Charge creating code is expected to return a chunk of syntatically
  valid SVG code, it does not have to be enclosed within one element.
  One or more &quot;path&quot; elements are preferred, although
  simple shapes such as &quot;rect&quot; and &quot;polygon&quot; may
  be used if this helps. The area that will be filled by the charge
  colour should not have any &quot;fill&quot; set. Note that this not
  the same as setting the fill to &quot;none&quot;. If you must have
  the fill attribute it should be set to &quot;inherit&quot;.</p>
  <p>Areas that are shaded (like shadows or details) may be filled
  as required. Lines may be stroked as required, although black is
  preferred.</p>
  <p>The SVG code must <strong>NOT CONTAIN:</strong></p>
  <ul>
  <li>References to gradiants or anything else that requires use of the
  &quot;defs&quot; element.</li>
  <li>&quot;use&quot; elements</li>
  <li>Any elements that are transformed in any way<span class="noteref">Inkscape
  can be used to convert all elements to paths and then combine then. This will
  remove the need for transforms.</span></li>
  </ul>
