#summary Ordinaries - Shapes over the whole field

=Description=

Ordinaries are (typically) large shapes that occupy a significant portion of the [Field field]. They can be of
any [Tincture tincture], and in most cases can themselves be split by a [Division division].

The basic syntax is:

*a* (*an*) [Ordinaries Ordinary] [LineTypes Line Type] [OrdModifier Ordinary Modifier] [Tincture]


==Large Ordinaries==

These are the large ordinaries, most of which can be drawn with variant [LineTypes line types]:

*base*, *bend*, *bend sinister*, *chevron*, *chevron inverted*, *chevron rompu*, *chevron throughout*,
*chevron couched*, *chevron fracted {disjoint*, *debruised}*, *chief*, *chief triangular*, *cross*,
*cross formy throughout*, *cross-fillet*, *cross quarter pierced*, *cross parted and fretty*,
*cross tripartite and fretty*, *fess*, *inescutcheon*,
*pale*, *pall*, *pile*, *pile inverted*, *quarter*, *quarter sinister*, *saltire*, *tierce*,
*tierce sinister*

==Diminutives==

Some of the larger ordinaries come in smaller versions, that can appear multiple times. (If no number is
given, or the diminutive is plural, then 4 is assumed). Note that *between* 
and *on* (see below) don't really make sense with these ordinaries. The available diminutives are:

*bar*, *bar gemel*, *palet*, *bendlet* {*scarpe*}, (up to 8 of each) *chevronel*, *chevronel interlaced* 
{*chevronel braced*}, *piles* (up to 4 of each)

There are various nuances, which are shown in the table below:

|| *Diminutive* || *Can be drawn with Variant Linetypes?* || *Number Range* ||
|| bar || Yes || 1 - 8 ||
|| bar gemel || Yes || 1 - 8 ||
|| palet || Yes || 1 - 8 ||
|| bendlet || Yes || 1 - 8 ||
|| chevronel || No || 1 - 4 ||
|| chevronel interlaced || No || 2 - 4 ||
|| piles || No || 2 - 4 ||
 

==Sub-Ordinaries

These ordinaries are generally smaller and take up less of the space on the field.

*fret*, *escutcheon*, *orle*, *bordure*, *canton*, *gyron*, *baton*, *graft*, *gusset*, *shakefork*, *pall*, *tressure*, *double-tressure*, *flaunch*, *square flaunch*

They have various little nuances, which are captured in the table below

|| *Sub-Ordinary* || *Can be drawn with Variant Linetypes?* || *Action if 2 requested* || *Action if > 2 requested* || 
|| fret  || No	|| Treated as a charge || Treated as a charge || 
|| escutcheon || No	|| Treated as a charge || Treated as a charge ||
|| orle || No	|| Number silently ignored || Number silently ignored ||
|| bordure || No	|| Number silently ignored || Number silently ignored ||
|| canton || Yes || Dexter and sinister drawn || Number silently ignored ||
|| gore || Yes || Dexter and sinister drawn || Number silently ignored ||
|| gyron || Yes || Dexter and sinister drawn || Number silently ignored ||
|| baton || No	|| Number silently ignored || Number silently ignored ||
|| graft || No  || Dexter and sinister drawn || Number silently ignored || 
|| gusset || No  || Dexter and sinister drawn || Number silently ignored || 
|| shakefork || No	|| Number silently ignored || Number silently ignored ||
|| pall || No	|| Number silently ignored || Number silently ignored ||
|| tressure || No	|| Number silently ignored || Number silently ignored ||
|| double-tressure || No	|| Number silently ignored || Number silently ignored ||
|| flaunch || No  || Dexter and sinister drawn || Number silently ignored || 
|| square flaunch || No  || Dexter and sinister drawn || Number silently ignored || 

==Combining Charges and Ordinaries==

It is possible to combine [Charges] with [Ordinaries] in various ways:

  * One or more charges placed around or within an ordinary
  * One or more charges placed on the ordinary
  * Some charges around the ordinary and some (other) charges on the ordinary
  
The basic syntax is as follows, where Ordinary indicates the normal syntax for an ordinary, as shown above.


[Ordinaries Ordinary] *between* [Number] [Charges]

[Ordinaries Ordinary] *within* [Number] [Charges]

*on* [Ordinaries Ordinary] [Number] [Charges]

*on* [Ordinaries Ordinary] *between* [Number] [Charges Charges (between)] [Number] [Charges Charges (on)]


==Combining Ordinaries==

It is also possible to place one ordinary on top of another:

*on* [Ordinaries Ordinary] [Ordinaries Ordinary] 

Normally the second ordinary is only visible where it overlays the first one, look for example at:


{{{
Azure, on a bend or a fess gules
}}}
[http://www.karlwilcox.com/images/wiki/ordinary-ex1.png]

However, the *chief* and *canton* are often used as an augmentation or difference and so are treated a little
differently if they are the first ordinary - the second ordinary is scaled to fit entirely on the chief or
canton. Compare the blazon below with the one above:
{{{
Azure, on a canton or a fess gules
}}}

=Points To Note=

If an ordinary cannot be drawn with the specified line type it is drawn with straight edges but no error message is generated.
