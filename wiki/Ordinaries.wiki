#summary Ordinaries - Shapes over the whole field

=Description=

Ordinaries are (typically) large shapes that occupy a significant portion of the [Field field]. They can be of
any [Tincture tincture], and in most cases can themselves be split by a [Division division].

The basic syntax is:

{{{
a [Ordinaries Ordinary] [LineTypes Line Type] [OrdModifier Ordinary Modifier] [Tincture]
}}}

==Large Ordinaries==

These are the large ordinaries, most of which can be drawn with variant [LineTypes line types]:

*base*, *bend*, *bordure*, *canton*, *chevron*, *chevron inverted*, *chevron rompu*, *chevron throughout*,
*chevron couched*, *chevron fracted {disjoint*, *debruised}*, *chief*, *chief triangular*, *cross**, *
*cross formy throughout*, *cross-fillet*, *cross quarter pierced*, *cross parted and fretty*,
*cross tripartite and fretty*, *fess*, *flaunch*, *fret*, *gore*, *gyron*, *inescutcheon*, *orle*,
*pale*, *pall*, *pile*, *pile inverted*, *quarter*, *saltire*, *tierce*


==Combining Charges and Ordinaries==

It is possible to combine [Charges] with [Ordinaries] in various ways:

  * One or more charges placed around or within an ordinary
  * One or more charges placed on the ordinary
  * Some charges around the ordinary and some (other) charges on the ordinary
  
The basic syntax is as follows, where Ordinary indicates the normal syntax for an ordinary, as shown above.

{{{
[Ordinaries Ordinary] *between* [Number] [Charges]

[Ordinaries Ordinary] *within* [Number] [Charges]

*on* [Ordinaries Ordinary] [Number] [Charges]

*on* [Ordinaries Ordinary] *between* [Number] [Charges Charges (between)] [Number] [Charges Charges (on)]
}}}

==Combining Ordinaries==

It is also possible to place one ordinary on top of another:

{{{
[Ordinaries Ordinary] *on* 

The *chief* and *canton* are often used as an augmentation or difference and so have an extra feature in
that they can have another ordinary pla

=Points To Note=

If an ordinary cannot be drawn with the specified line type it is drawn with straight edges but no error message is generated.
