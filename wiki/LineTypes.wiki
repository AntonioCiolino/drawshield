#summary LineTypes - Variations on a straight line

=Description=

Most divisions, and some of the larger ordinaries can be drawn with patterned
edges, rather than straight lines. 

==Line Types==

The variant line types available are:

*battled-embattled*, *battled-counter-embattled*, *dancetty*, *dovetailed*, *embattled*, *engrailed*, *indented*, *invected*, *nebuly*, *potenty*, *raguly*, *rayonny*, *urdy*, *wavy*, *angled*, *bevilled*, *escartelly*, *nowy*, *arched* (*enarched*), *double-arched*

=Points to Note=

There are some limitations, and some
situations where the program does not join lines neatly. I am thinking about
ways of improving this but it is proving difficult to find a neat, generic
solution that works in every situation!
