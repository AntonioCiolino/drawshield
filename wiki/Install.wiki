#summary Drawshield Installation Instructions
= Installation Instructions =

All files should be placed into a folder named "shield" somewhere in your PHP include path, 
(e.g. /www/include/shield). All file references in the drawshield code are relative to this 
"shield" folder.

See [Usage] for information on how to call the drawshield program.

==Optional components==

There is one sub-folder for each output format supported, if you only intend to produce SVG output
then you do not need the sub-folders "blazonml" and "prepro" - although you may wish to modify the
top-level file "drawshield.php" to match this more limited range of outputs.

(The sub-folder named "regress" is for regression testing only and is not necessary for operation -
regression testing can cause quite a CPU hit so it may be best to remove this folder in a production
environment).

==Other Information==

See also the [Requirements] page for the PHP environment that has been used for development.
