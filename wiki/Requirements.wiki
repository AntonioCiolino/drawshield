#summary Requirements for running DrawShield

=PHP Requirements=

Drawshield is written in PHP. For increased compatibility (and because my web site host only supports it), 
Drawshield used PHP 4.3.

Extensive use is made of XML and XSLT transforms, requiring *domxml* and *xslt* 
(the _sablotron_ backend and its required dlls).

The regression test suite uses the PEAR Text_Diff extension.

The author tests on Apache 1.3.37 with PHP 4.3.11 on a Windows XP host.

=SVG Requirements=

Almost all open source SVG implementations seem to be broken in one way or another. The author targets
the latest stable releases of Firefox and Chrome under Windows XP to at least not crash, even if both do not
display everything correctly.

The SVG Viewer with the Oxygen XML Editor (a commercial product) is used as reference for valid SVG.
