#summary Ordinary Modifiers - Changes to features of ordinaries

=Description=

In addition to be being drawn with variant edge types, ordinaries may also have other modifiers applied
which may affect how they are drawn, or their placement. They usually come between the ordinary and its tincture,
however there are some exceptions noted below.

==The Modifiers==

The following modifiers are available:

*voided*, *fimbriated* (*edged*), {*double*, *treble*} *cotised* (*endorsed*, *cotticed*), 
*enhanced*, *abased*, *couped* {*in base*, *in chief*, *dexter*, *sinister*}, 
*lozengy*, *compony* (*gobony*), *counter compony*.

There are many quirks to each of these, which I have tried to capture in this table:

|| *Modifier* || *Description* || *Tinctures* || *position* ||
|| voided || Drawn in outline only || if followed by a tincture the interior is drawn that colour || follows the ordinary tincture ||
|| fimbriated || Edges drawn in different colour || must be followed by a tincture || follows the ordinary tincture ||
|| cotised || 1, 2 or 3 extra edges drawn || if followed by a tincture, extra edges drawn in that colour || follows the ordinary tincture, can also have their own variant line type, see below ||
|| enhanced, abased || moved up, down || none || before or after the ordinary ||
|| couped || cut short (at a particular end) || none || between the ordinary and its tincture ||
|| lozengy, compony, counter compony || filled with a fixed pattern || must be followed by two tinctures || follows the ordinary ||

Cotticing can be quite complex, here are some examples:

{{{
Azure a bend cotticed or

Azure a bend or cotticed vert

Azure a bend or cotticed invected vert 

Azure a bend or double cotticed invected vert
}}}

=Points to Note=

There are many situations when combinations of modifiers, or modifiers and particular ordinaries
do not make sense. The program may ignore these or may draw strange things. If you stick to real
blazons then you should not come across these situations.
